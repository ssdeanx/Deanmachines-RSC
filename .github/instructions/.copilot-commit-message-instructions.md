# CRITICAL COMMIT MESSAGE GENERATION GUIDELINES:

- The generated commit message MUST be a comprehensive, detailed, and structured record of ALL changes made in the current commit.
- It should serve as a complete changelog entry, providing exhaustive context for future reference.
- Strictly adhere to Conventional Commits v1.0.0 (https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for the overall structure.
- Support AI-assisted generation with human review and approval workflow when available.

## Use the precise format:
- `<type>(<scope>): <subject>\n\n[ uitgebreide body ]\n\n[optional footer(s)]`. 
  - The double newline after the subject is critical.
- Allowed `<type>` values: `feat` (new feature), `fix` (bug fix), `build` (build system/dependencies), `chore` (repo maintenance, no production code change), `ci` (CI config), `docs` (documentation), `perf` (performance improvement), `refactor` (code change, neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature), `revert` (reverts a previous commit), `style` (formatting, white-space), `test` (adding/refactoring tests).
- Optional gitmoji support with `ðŸŽ¨ style(ui): ` prefix for enhanced visual commit history when appropriate.
- The `<scope>` MUST be a lowercase noun accurately identifying the primary logical module, component, file, or functional area affected by the changes (e.g., `middlware`, `mastra`, `copilotkit`, `components/copilotkit`, `agentMemory`, `rag-tools`, `ci-pipeline`, `readme`).
- Use intelligent scope detection based on file patterns and change analysis when possible.
- Be as specific as possible to the most significant area of change.
- If multiple scopes are significantly affected, choose the most prominent or consider splitting the commit."
- The `<subject>` MUST be a concise summary of the change in imperative mood (e.g., 'add user authentication feature', 'fix memory leak in data processing'), starting with a lowercase letter, with a maximum of 72 characters, and NO trailing period. It should succinctly describe the *what* of the change. THIS SUBJECT LINE LIMIT IS IMPORTANT FOR GIT TOOL COMPATIBILITY.

# THE BODY IS CRITICAL FOR EXTREMELY DETAILED CONTEXT AND SERVING AS A COMPREHENSIVE CHANGELOG
- For ALL changes, the body MUST be exhaustive. 
- Include automated impact analysis and change categorization when available.
- It should:
  - 1. Clearly and extensively explain the 'what' and 'why' of the changes.
  - 2. Describe in detail the problem, context, or user story that necessitated the change.
  - 3. Detail the solution implemented, including architectural decisions or alternatives considered if applicable. 
  - 4. **Provide an exhaustive list of ALL key files, components, classes, functions, methods, or modules that were added, removed, or significantly modified. For each item, describe the specific nature of the change with as much detail as practical** (e.g., 'In `NewComponent.tsx`: Added component to manage user preferences, including state for X, Y, Z and API calls to A, B. Implemented methods `handleSave`, `loadPreferences`.', 'In `data-utils.ts`: Refactored `processData()` to use a new algorithm for improved performance when handling large datasets, reducing complexity from O(n^2) to O(n log n). Modified parameters to include Z.', 'In `legacy-module.ts`: Removed obsolete function `oldFunction()` and all its usages throughout the affected files [list affected files if few, or describe generally if many]').
  - 5. If applicable, detail any impact on other parts of the system, user-facing changes (UI/UX), API contract changes, or database schema modifications.
  - 6. Include security impact assessment and performance implications when relevant.
  - 7. Reference any automated testing coverage changes and deployment considerations.
  - 8. **There is NO strict line wrap limit for the body; prioritize completeness and detail over line length constraints.** However, use paragraphs and bullet points for readability of long-form content. The goal is maximum information transfer."

# Footers MUST ONLY be used for metadata.
- Common footers include:
- `Refs: ORG-XXX` (for linking to Jira issues or other tracking systems).
- `Fixes: #123` or `Closes: #123` (for linking to GitHub issues that this commit resolves).
- `Co-authored-by: Name <email>` for pair programming or collaborative commits.
- `Reviewed-by: Name <email>` for code review acknowledgments.
- `AI-assisted: true` to indicate AI-generated commit messages with human approval.
- `BREAKING CHANGE: <A detailed description of the breaking change, its impact, and clear migration instructions for users/developers>`. This footer is MANDATORY and must be thorough if the commit introduces a breaking change.
- The generated commit message MUST comprehensively reflect ALL staged changes, their purpose, and their impact.
- Support automated semantic versioning integration and changelog generation when configured.
- It should also be structured to pass any project-specific `commitlint` configurations, if present (though body length rules in commitlint might need adjustment for this verbose style).
- Include compatibility with modern commit message tools like `ai-commit`, `opencommit`, and `gitmoji-cli`.
- AIM FOR A COMMIT MESSAGE THAT IS A SELF-CONTAINED, EXHAUSTIVE RECORD OF THE CHANGES, SUITABLE FOR DIRECT USE AS A DETAILED CHANGELOG ENTRY. Prioritize thoroughness and complete context above all else for the commit body.

## MODERN WORKFLOW INTEGRATION:
- Support multi-suggestion generation (3-5 commit message options) for user selection when available.
- Allow project-specific commit message templates and customization.
- Enable interactive refinement and iterative improvement of generated messages.
- Use file patterns and diff analysis for intelligent scope and type suggestion.
- Ensure compatibility with Git hooks, commitizen, and modern commitlint configurations.
