# CRITICAL COMMIT MESSAGE GENERATION GUIDELINES:

- The generated commit message MUST be a comprehensive, detailed, and structured record of ALL changes made in the current commit.
- It should serve as a complete changelog entry, providing exhaustive context for future reference.
- Strictly adhere to Conventional Commits v1.0.0 (https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for the overall structure.

## Use the precise format:
- `<type>(<scope>): <subject>\n\n[ uitgebreide body ]\n\n[optional footer(s)]`. 
  - The double newline after the subject is critical.
- Allowed `<type>` values: `feat` (new feature), `fix` (bug fix), `build` (build system/dependencies), `chore` (repo maintenance, no production code change), `ci` (CI config), `docs` (documentation), `perf` (performance improvement), `refactor` (code change, neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature), `revert` (reverts a previous commit), `style` (formatting, white-space), `test` (adding/refactoring tests).
- The `<scope>` MUST be a lowercase noun accurately identifying the primary logical module, component, file, or functional area affected by the changes (e.g., `auth`, `app-builder-ui`, `ai-sdk-chat`, `file-tree`, `supabase-adapter`, `rag-tools`, `ci-pipeline`, `readme-docs`).
- Be as specific as possible to the most significant area of change.
- If multiple scopes are significantly affected, choose the most prominent or consider splitting the commit."
- The `<subject>` MUST be a concise summary of the change in imperative mood (e.g., 'add user authentication feature', 'fix memory leak in data processing'), starting with a lowercase letter, with a maximum of 72 characters, and NO trailing period. It should succinctly describe the *what* of the change. THIS SUBJECT LINE LIMIT IS IMPORTANT FOR GIT TOOL COMPATIBILITY.

# THE BODY IS CRITICAL FOR EXTREMELY DETAILED CONTEXT AND SERVING AS A COMPREHENSIVE CHANGELOG
- For ALL changes, the body MUST be exhaustive. 
- It should:
  - 1. Clearly and extensively explain the 'what' and 'why' of the changes.
  - 2. Describe in detail the problem, context, or user story that necessitated the change.
  - 3. Detail the solution implemented, including architectural decisions or alternatives considered if applicable. 
  - 4. **Provide an exhaustive list of ALL key files, components, classes, functions, methods, or modules that were added, removed, or significantly modified. For each item, describe the specific nature of the change with as much detail as practical** (e.g., 'In `NewComponent.tsx`: Added component to manage user preferences, including state for X, Y, Z and API calls to A, B. Implemented methods `handleSave`, `loadPreferences`.', 'In `data-utils.ts`: Refactored `processData()` to use a new algorithm for improved performance when handling large datasets, reducing complexity from O(n^2) to O(n log n). Modified parameters to include Z.', 'In `legacy-module.ts`: Removed obsolete function `oldFunction()` and all its usages throughout the affected files [list affected files if few, or describe generally if many]').
  - 5. If applicable, detail any impact on other parts of the system, user-facing changes (UI/UX), API contract changes, or database schema modifications.
  - 6. **There is NO strict line wrap limit for the body; prioritize completeness and detail over line length constraints.** However, use paragraphs and bullet points for readability of long-form content. The goal is maximum information transfer."

# Footers MUST ONLY be used for metadata.
- Common footers include:
- `Refs: ORG-XXX` (for linking to Jira issues or other tracking systems).
- `Fixes: #123` or `Closes: #123` (for linking to GitHub issues that this commit resolves).
- `BREAKING CHANGE: <A detailed description of the breaking change, its impact, and clear migration instructions for users/developers>`. This footer is MANDATORY and must be thorough if the commit introduces a breaking change.
- The generated commit message MUST comprehensively reflect ALL staged changes, their purpose, and their impact.
- It should also be structured to pass any project-specific `commitlint` configurations, if present (though body length rules in commitlint might need adjustment for this verbose style).
- AIM FOR A COMMIT MESSAGE THAT IS A SELF-CONTAINED, EXHAUSTIVE RECORD OF THE CHANGES, SUITABLE FOR DIRECT USE AS A DETAILED CHANGELOG ENTRY. Prioritize thoroughness and complete context above all else for the commit body.
