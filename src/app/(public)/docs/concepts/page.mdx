# Basic Concepts

Understanding the **fundamental concepts** of DeanMachines RSC is essential for building effective AI-powered applications. This guide covers the core terminology, architecture patterns, and mental models you need to succeed.

## Core Components

### Agents
**Autonomous AI entities** that can understand, reason, and act on behalf of users.

### Tools
**Functional capabilities** that extend what agents can do beyond text generation.

Tools enable agents to:
- **File Operations**: Read, write, and manipulate files
- **Web Interactions**: Search the internet, fetch web pages, scrape data
- **API Integrations**: Connect to external services and databases
- **System Operations**: Execute commands, manage processes
- **Data Processing**: Analyze, transform, and visualize data

### Memory
**Persistent knowledge storage** that allows agents to maintain context across conversations.

  <Info className="h-4 w-4" />
  <AlertTitle>Memory Types</AlertTitle>
  <AlertDescription>
    DeanMachines RSC uses both **short-term memory** (conversation context) and **long-term memory** (persistent knowledge graphs) to provide intelligent, context-aware responses.

### Workflows
**Orchestrated sequences** of agent interactions that accomplish complex tasks.

Example workflow: Repository Analysis
1. **Git Agent** clones the repository
2. **Code Agent** analyzes file structure and dependencies
3. **Graph Agent** generates visual dependency maps
4. **Documentation Agent** creates summary reports
5. **Master Agent** coordinates and presents results

## Key Concepts

### Runtime Context
**Configuration and state information** that agents use during execution.

```typescript
// Example: Weather Agent Runtime Context
export type WeatherAgentRuntimeContext = {
  "user-id": string;           // User identification
  "session-id": string;        // Session tracking
  "location-preference": string; // Default location
  "units": string;             // Temperature units (metric/imperial)
  "forecast-days": string;     // Default forecast period
  "weather-alerts": string;    // Alert preferences
};
```

### Model Context Protocol (MCP)
**Standardized interface** for tool integration that ensures consistency and reliability.

Benefits of MCP:
- **Standardization**: Consistent tool interfaces across all agents
- **Reliability**: Robust error handling and validation
- **Scalability**: Easy addition of new tools and capabilities
- **Interoperability**: Tools work seamlessly across different agents

### AG-UI Protocol
**Communication bridge** between Mastra agents and CopilotKit frontend interfaces.

The AG-UI protocol handles:
- **Real-time Communication**: Streaming responses and updates
- **State Synchronization**: Frontend-backend state management
- **Tool Execution**: Visual feedback for agent tool usage
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error recovery and user feedback

## Architecture Patterns

### Agent Specialization
Each agent is designed for **specific domains** rather than being a general-purpose assistant.

**Benefits**:
- **Expertise**: Deep knowledge in specific areas
- **Performance**: Optimized for particular use cases
- **Maintainability**: Easier to update and improve specific capabilities
- **Reliability**: Reduced complexity leads to more predictable behavior

### Coordination Over Centralization
The **Master Agent** coordinates other agents rather than trying to do everything itself.

**Pattern**:
```typescript
// Master Agent delegates to specialists
const analysisResult = await masterAgent.coordinate([
  { agent: 'git-agent', task: 'clone-repository', params: { url } },
  { agent: 'code-agent', task: 'analyze-structure', params: { path } },
  { agent: 'graph-agent', task: 'generate-visualization', params: { data } }
]);
```

### Memory-Driven Intelligence
Agents use **persistent memory** to provide increasingly intelligent responses over time.

**Memory Categories**:
- **User Preferences**: Personal settings and preferences
- **Project Context**: Information about specific projects or repositories
- **Interaction History**: Previous conversations and outcomes
- **Knowledge Base**: Accumulated facts and insights

### Tool Composition
Complex capabilities are built by **composing simple tools** rather than creating monolithic functions.

**Example**: Repository analysis combines:
- File system tools (reading files)
- Git tools (repository operations)
- Analysis tools (code parsing)
- Visualization tools (graph generation)

## Development Mental Models

### Think in Workflows
Instead of single-step operations, design **multi-step workflows** that leverage multiple agents.

**Good**: "Analyze this repository by coordinating Git, Code, and Graph agents"
**Better**: "Create a comprehensive repository analysis workflow with dependency mapping, code quality assessment, and documentation generation"

### Embrace Specialization
Design agents with **clear, focused purposes** rather than trying to make them do everything.

**Good**: Weather agent that provides weather information
**Better**: Weather agent that provides location-based forecasts, weather alerts, historical data, and climate insights

### Memory as Intelligence
Use **persistent memory** to make agents smarter over time rather than treating each interaction as isolated.

**Good**: Agent that answers questions about code
**Better**: Agent that remembers previous code discussions, learns project patterns, and provides increasingly relevant suggestions

### Tools as Extensions
Think of tools as **extensions of agent capabilities** rather than separate systems.

**Good**: Agent that can search the web
**Better**: Agent that seamlessly integrates web search, content analysis, fact verification, and knowledge synthesis

## Best Practices

### 1. **Clear Separation of Concerns**
Each agent should have a well-defined purpose and scope.

### 2. **Consistent Interfaces**
Use standardized patterns for agent creation, tool integration, and memory management.

### 3. **Error Resilience**
Design agents and workflows to handle failures gracefully and provide meaningful feedback.

### 4. **Performance Optimization**
Consider memory usage, response times, and resource consumption in agent design.

### 5. **User Experience**
Design agent interactions to be intuitive, helpful, and aligned with user expectations.
